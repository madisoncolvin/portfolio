          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            Throughout my business capstone course we were assigned multiple case studies to complete individually. In these case studies 
            we were expected to apply frameworks taught in the class to the assigned cases. The following write up was my personal recommendation 
            for the Harvard Business Review case study: Class or Mass. 
          </p>
          <h4>Executive Summary</h4>
          <p>
            Neptune Gourmet Seafood, a $820 million seafood supply company, is dealing with an internal issue of a surplus inventory of finished goods 
            with no current way to sell their excess supply. Over 60% of the company’s sales are to high-end grocery stores and restaurants, where the 
            quality of their products positions them as a market leader. Neptune currently enjoys a 30% higher price point over their competition due 
            to their reputation of producing quality products. The company recently invested in upgrading their technology and equipment, including $9 
            million in freezer trawlers that increased shelf life by 50% and added $54 million in ships to its fleet that could catch fish more 
            efficiently than ever before, leading to a supply that is exceeding demand by 33% each month. If this issue is not resolved, the 
            company will lose potential revenue and profit from the overstock of perishable goods. 
          </p>
          <p>
            My recommendation below demonstrates that it is best for Neptune to grow demand through expanding its current product line, Neptune’s Gold, 
            into the European Market. Through this strategy, Neptune will be able deplete its spare inventory by entering a market with similar 
            tastes and buying power as the U.S. with its already well-established and high quality brand.
          </p>
          <p> 
            Finally, in the future, Neptune should be more careful when investing in costly technology upgrades and not focus its 
            efforts on maximizing supply, but aim to meet the market’s demand in the most efficient way.
          </p>
          <h4>External Analysis Summary</h4>
          <p>
            The PESTEL Analysis identifies that there are political pressures from the U.S. Association of Seafood Processors 
            and Distributors (ASPD) to maintain Neptune’s Gold Seal of Approval on all of their products, offering a low cost alternative 
            puts their perfect Gold status at risk. Additionally, the PESTEL Analysis identifies there are new legal issues such as strict 
            fishing laws which force the company to fish further out at sea. Neptune has recently invested $54 million in new ships that 
            reduce their environmental impact by only catching mature fish, but their investments have increased efficiency dramatically 
            and overshot the market demand, leaving the company overstocked with perishable goods. The Stakeholder Analysis (Appendix B) 
            demonstrates the conflicting interests by individuals involved with Neptune and by larger organizations, which will shape the 
            evaluation of alternatives. 
          </p>
          <h4>Internal Analysis Summary</h4>
          <p>The Resources and Capabilities/VRIO analysis points out that the company has difficult to replicate advantages, 
            including advanced equipment and technology, ASPD Gold Seal of Approval on all products, and a renowned reputation for producing 
            high quality products that sell for 30% more than the competition. The company’s advanced technology is costly and difficult to 
            obtain, but as technology is constantly advancing it will be difficult for Neptune to maintain this advantage as it is not 
            easily sustainable. Additionally, Neptune is the only company in the industry to have the Gold Seal of Approval on all of 
            its products, but this advantage may not be sustainable as other firms increase quality or as Neptune introduces new 
            products. The Activity Map shows that high quality, product availability, ASPD approval, and above average 
            willingness to pay are part of the company's value proposition, which are based on the company’s advanced technology, 
            reliable supply, established brand name, and history of being a trusted seller.  
          </p>
          <p>
            The Root Cause Analysis dives into the issues Neptune is currently facing, including the possibility of entering 
            a price war with the competition by selling a mass market seafood brand, dropping sales by 40-50% and risk diluting the brand 
            image, lowering product cost and risking ASPD approval, and new tech and regulations leading the company to catch more fish 
            than they can sell. The issue of supply exceeding demand is the underlying root cause of the current issues Neptune is facing, 
            indicating that the problem can be solved by determining the most efficient way to get rid of their stock and sell more goods.
          </p>
          <h4>SWOT analysis</h4>
          <p>Based on the analysis and frameworks showcased in the appendix and the summaries above, the following SWOT analysis represents the key issues presented in the case.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/portfolio/class/swot.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">

          <h4>Evaluation criteria and definition</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> Profitability/Sustainability: how does this affect the bottom line and its durability? How this will impact profits and ROI? </li>
            <li> Customers: How are they impacted? Customer base includes restaurants, wholesalers, grocery stores, and individuals. </li>
            <li> Employees: Who is harmed and who is benefited and impacted?</li>
            <li> Competitor Risk: ability for competitors to easily respond and the ability to mitigate them?</li>
            <li> Competitive Advantage: Does it leverage and build CA?</li>
            <li> Risk:  Is there a high likelihood that this alternative will succeed in the market?</li>
            <li> Risk: Will this damage Neptune’s premium brand image?</li>
            <li> Will the government and law approve of this alternative?</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Alternatives</h4>
          <p>The case presents multiple solutions to consider, but the differences in the company's stakeholder objectives is creating an inability to 
            decide on a rational solution that will please all involved. The root causes outlined in the appendix are driving the differences 
            between the parties. To resolve this issue we must look at what options are going to get rid of excess inventory and generate the largest 
            amount of profit for Neptune without cannibalizing sales, damaging the brand image, or losing ASPD approval. Through analysis of the case 
            and frameworks in the appendix, I have developed three alternate solutions that could be implemented by Neptune to solve their issue of 
            supply exceeding product demand. Solutions proposed include:.
          </p>
          <p><b> Donate excess supply to charities and food banks near Neptune’s manufacturing facilities. </b>This idea could generate positive 
            publicity for the company and would be a better use of the product than letting the products go bad in storage facilities. In turn, 
            the media exposure could boost demand in the months to come and increase Neptune’s sales, depleting their excess supply. Furthermore, 
            this solution could be used as a tax write off for the firm providing a financial incentive to donate their products rather than letting 
            them go to waste. However, this option would not sell products, which in the short term would mean reduced sales and lower 
            revenue for the firm. 
          </p>
          <p><b>2. Create a mass market brand to liquidate surplus products at a low price under a lower-end brand.</b> To reduce the risk of diluting Neptune’s elite brand image, the firm should 
            rebrand their products and not mention their current brand name “Neptune’s Gold'' or any deviation of Neptune, such as “Neptune’s Silver” as suggested in the case. 
            In addition to the rebrand, the firm would have to target a new customer base so that their current target market doesn't switch to the cheaper brand and cannibalize 
            their own sales. Neptune should target price sensitive customers at superstores such as Target and Walmart, the proposed brand would excel at these locations as the 
            consumer base at superstores are interested in finding the lowest price possible opposed to high-quality products. On the other hand, Neptune will no longer be competing 
            on quality and instead will be competing mainly on price, risking a price war with its competition. </p>
          <p><b>3. Enter the European market and sell Neptune Gourmet Seafood’s current brand: Neptune’s Gold.. </b> To ensure Neptune maintains 
            its premium brand image, doesn’t cannibalize sales, and sells its excess supply, Neptune should expand overseas to a new market that is similar 
            to its current high-end U.S. market. Europe is the perfect market to enter because of its large market potential and huge demand for seafood. 
            In 2018, Europe was the second largest fish and seafood importer in the world with a value of $22.1 billion. With Neptune’s 
            already well established reputation in the U.S. market, they are bound to quickly gain traction in the European market and sell their 
            overstocked supply at normal rates, but Neptune should also be prepared to face new competition with high product quality in this market.
          </p>
          <h4>Alternatives Evaluation Matrix</h4>
          <img src="assets/img/portfolio/class/alternatives.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
          <h4>Recommendations</h4>
          <p>
            Based on the Evaluations Matrix above, there are several strategic recommendations to solve Neptune Gourmet Seafood’s overstocking issue, 
            but the solution to which Neptune would benefit most from would be to sell their current product, Neptune’s Gold, in the European market.
          </p>
          <p>
            The EU is one of the largest markets for U.S. seafood exports, accounting for a total of 22% U.S. seafood exports in 2015. Additionally, 
            the EU has an annual average per capita consumption of around 23.81 kg, which is approximately 7 kg greater than the world average, 
            17 kg per year. Neptune has positioned themselves as a high-end seafood brand with high quality products, this reputation 
            will help carry them into this new market and allow them the ability to keep their high prices for their premium brand. In turn, this 
            solution will resolve many issues among their stakeholders, allowing for them to keep their brand image, not risk their ASPD Gold Seal 
            of Approval, and not have to cannibalize their current brand to sell products.  
          </p>
          <p>
            The Neptune team should consider first entering into European high-end grocery stores and restaurants like they have done previously 
            in the U.S. market. In the future they consider the implications of technology and equipment upgrades before investing, 
            so they can better plan for their supply to meet projected demand.
          </p>
