          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            Throughout my business capstone course we were assigned multiple case studies to complete individually. In these case studies we 
            were expected to apply frameworks taught in the class to the assigned cases. The following write up was my personal recommendation for 
            the Harvard Business Review case study: Holding Fast. 
          </p>
          <h4>Executive Summary</h4>
          <p>
            Crescordia, a market leader in medical fixation devices, has built a distinguished brand reputation in the medical industry and is well 
            known across the world for supplying premier, high-quality medical products. Crescordia currently only offers steel and titanium fixation 
            devices, while competitors in their market are beginning to explore and release new resorbable fixation devices. Resorbable fixation devices 
            are engineered to dissolve in a patient's body over time, thus eliminating the removal procedure required with normal fixation devices and 
            making the process less invasive while saving operation time. Before this technology was introduced to market, Crescordia had already 
            developed a resorbable fixation device of their own, the product had been run through rigorous and thorough testing, but the product failed 
            8% of the time and was never introduced to market. Although Crescordia never entered the market with their product, a competitor, Innostat, 
            decided to enter the medical market with a resorbable fixation device with an even higher product failure rate than Crescordia’s. Despite its 
            high failure rate, the product did extremely well, proving to be extremely popular, especially for pediatric patients as the surgeries are 
            ess invasive than typical fixation device procedures. The new technology has since changed market demand and has threatened Crescordia’s 
            market share. Crescordia is now faced with the issue in which they must decide if, and how, to release their resorbable fixation devices 
            without damaging their brand image. </p>
          <p>
            My recommendation below demonstrates that the best course of action for Crescordia to grow their market share and increase profitability 
            is to introduce a full set of implants, screws, plates, and devices needed for resorbable fixation devices to the market. Through this strategy, 
            Crescordia will be able to regain lost customers and acquire new markets such as pediatric departments. Although their current product doesn’t 
            have a 100% success rate, their product is better than the competition’s, positioning them as the clear choice in resorbable fixation devices.
          </p>
          <h4>External Analysis Summary</h4>
          <p>
            The PESTEL Analysis identifies that there are external legal pressures that Crescordia faces when deciding to launch a new medical product. 
            Changing laws and regulations could influence the products Crescordia is allowed to manufacture and bring to market. Additionally, as Crescordia’s 
            products are used for medical purposes, the company must consider legal repercussions and lawsuits from patients or hospitals from distributing a 
            defective product. The Stakeholder Analysis demonstrates the conflicting interests of individuals and by larger organizations, which 
            will shape the evaluation of Crescordia’s alternatives. To appease their external stakeholders while doing what is best for the company, Crescordia 
            must consider the advice of its legal counsel Sam Maddox, to avoid legal repercussions. Additionally, the firm must do what is best for patients 
            receiving their products, doctors and surgeons performing the procedures, the hospitals purchasing their product, and consider its current 
            competition: Innostat. 
          </p>
          <h4>Internal Analysis Summary</h4>
          <p>The Resources and Capabilities/VRIO analysis indicates Crescordia has difficult to replicate advantages, including advanced technology, 
            prestigious reputation for producing high quality products, and they currently manufacture the most successful resorbable fixation products known 
            in the market. Crescordia’s advanced technology is difficult and costly to maintain, but in the medical industry it is essential for technology 
            to constantly advance, making it a difficult advantage for the company to sustain. In addition, Crescordia has manufactured the most successful 
            fixation device in the market, with a success rate of 92%, but this advantage is not sustainable as other companies in the industry begin 
            researching resorbable fixation devices and increase resorbable technology effectiveness. The Activity Map shows that high product quality, 
            industry connections, and established brand reputation are part of the company's value proposition, which are based on the company’s advanced technology, 
            history in the market, and only introducing products with a high success rate to market. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The Root Cause Analysis examines the issues Crescordia is currently facing, including losing customers to the competition, 
            complete fixation on quality, and the difficulty of testing resorbable products in a lab environment. The issue of Crescordia not 
            offering a resorbable product on the market is the underlying root cause of the issues the company is facing, indicating that most 
            of their current issues can be solved by launching their resorbable technology.
          </p>
          <h4>SWOT analysis</h4>
          <p>Based on the analysis and frameworks showcased in the appendix and the summaries above, the following SWOT analysis represents the key issues presented in the case.</p>
          <h4>Evaluation criteria and definition</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> Profitability/Sustainability: how does this affect the bottom line and its durability? </li>
            <li> Customers: How are they impacted? </li>
            <li> Employees: Who is harmed and who is benefited and impacted?</li>
            <li> Competitor Risk: ability for competitors to easily respond and the ability to mitigate them?</li>
            <li> Competitive Advantage: Does it leverage and build CA?</li>
            <li> Risk: How will this damage Crescordia’s high-quality brand reputation?</li>
            <li> Legality: Does this option risk legal repercussions?</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Alternatives</h4>
          <p>The case presents multiple solutions for Crescordia to consider, but the differences in the company's internal and external stakeholder objectives
             is causing a divide that is preventing the company from coming to a reasonable solution that will please all parties. 
             The Root Cause Analysis identifies the issues Crescordia is currently facing, in order to resolve these issues we must examine what 
             options will increase market share, gain back lost customers, and what solution will be most effective without damaging their current brand image. 
             Through reviewing the case and frameworks referenced in the appendix, I have constructed three viable solutions that could be implemented by 
             Crescordia to boost their customer base, regain lost customers, and maintain their high-quality brand image.
          </p>
          <p><b> 1. Manufacture and bring resorbable fixation devices to market. </b>To regain their lost customer base and capture a larger market 
            Crescordia should consider going all in with the production of resorbable fixation devices, including manufacturing a full set of implants, 
            plates, screws, and the hand and power tools needed to surgically implement these devices. The only other competitor on the market for resorbable 
            fixation devices is Innostat and Crescordia has already proven through product tests that their resorbable technology is more effective than the 
            competition. This advantage and their established brand reputation will give the company a competitive edge in the market. On the other hand, the 
            company still has a 8% product failure rate and could face legal repercussions and a hit to their brand reputation from selling a defective product. 
            In order to maintain their brand image and avoid potential lawsuits, the company needs to be transparent with the patients, doctors and hospitals about 
            their product success rates and run additional tests before entering the market. 
          </p>
          <p><b>2. Continue to develop and research steel and titanium fixation devices.</b> Crescordia has established itself as a high quality fixation device supplier. 
            Instead of changing their product line, they should consider sticking to what they do best to protect their brand image and continue to produce only 
            steel and titanium fixation devices. In contrast, not advancing with the industry could hurt their market share and could lose loyal buyers. Hospitals
             may switch to a supplier that offers a variety of fixation device technology as it is easier to source all of their supplies from one distributor. 
             By not keeping up with medical and technology trends, the company could be labeled as being “dated” and “old-school”, all of which are poor qualities 
             to be associated with medical devices, thus, they also risk damaging their brand’s reputation by doing nothing.</p>
          <p><b>3. Enter the pediatric market with resorbable fixation devices. </b> Resorbable technology is extremely popular with pediatric units as procedures are less invasive 
            and operations will only have to be performed once versus twice with steel and titanium fixation devices. Due to this, the pediatric market accounts for the 
            largest source of demand for product technology. By introducing a resorbable fixation device to the pediatric market, Crescordia could capture a new market 
            and regain their lost customers. Based on the success of the introduction Crescordia could make the decision to expand and enter other markets with their 
            resorbable technology. Although this solution could be good for business, this decision could create a multitude of serious issues for the company if 
            the resorbable products are substandard. Using children as the test subjects of the resorbable fixation devices could lead to lawsuits for the company, 
            a tarnished brand reputation, and the unethical sales to children if the product is unsuccessful could lower employee morale.
          </p>
          <h4>Alternatives Evaluation Matrix</h4>
          <img src="assets/img/portfolio/holding fast/matrix.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
          <h4>Recommendations</h4>
          <p>
            Based on the Evaluations Matrix above, there are several strategic recommendations that could be implemented to solve Crescordia’s current issues, 
            but the solution to which Crescordia and its stakeholders would benefit most from would be to manufacture and bring resorbable fixation devices to 
            market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crescordia has already demonstrated success in its ability to capture the market and poise itself as a market leader in the fixation device industry. 
            The company already possesses the status needed to enter the market with new technology, once buyers compare their product stats with what 
            is already on the market and see a well respected brand name attached to the product, customers won't hesitate to switch from Innostat’s 
            inferior product to Crescordia’s. Although their technology is not yet perfected, it is much better than what is currently on the market, 
            offering those who seek a resorbable fixation device a safer and more reliable option than the competition can. When introducing these 
            products to the market and to avoid any legal turmoil, Crescordia must be completely transparent with their customer’s and patient’s 
            about the product’s success rates. 
          </p>
          <p>
            With legal approval, Crescordia should also implement resorbable fixation device tests on willing adult patients before going 
            to the mass market with their product. By doing this, the company can see how the product interacts with the human body, instead 
            of only performing tests on cadavers in the lab, and make adjustments accordingly. Although this testing phase could add additional 
            time to their entrance to market, this strategy is vital when it comes to minimizing the legal risks of this product, retaining the 
            brands elite reputation, and putting the customer’s health as the number one priority.
          </p>
